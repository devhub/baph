            into only a single line.

        ``registration/activation_email.txt``
            This template will be used for the body of the email.

        These templates will each receive the following context
        variables:

        ``activation_key``
            The activation key for the new account.

        ``expiration_days``
            The number of days remaining during which the account may
            be activated.

        ``site``

            registered; depending on whether :mod:`baph.sites` is installed,

        Accounts to be deleted are identified by searching for
        instances of :class:`RegistrationProfile` with expired activation
        keys, and then checking to see if their associated ``User``
        instances have the field ``is_active`` set to ``False``; any
        ``User`` who is both inactive and has an expired activation
        key will be deleted.

        It is recommended that this method be executed regularly as
        part of your routine site maintenance; this application
        provides a custom management command which will call this
        method, accessible as ``manage.py cleanupregistration``.

        Regularly clearing out accounts which have never been
        activated serves two useful purposes:

        1. It alleviates the ocasional need to reset a
           :class:`RegistrationProfile` and/or re-send an activation email
           when a user does not receive or does not act upon the
           initial activation email; since the account will be
           deleted, the user will be able to simply re-register and
           receive a new activation key.

        2. It prevents the possibility of a malicious user registering
           one or more accounts and never activating them (thus
           denying the use of those usernames to anyone else); since
           those accounts will be deleted, the usernames will become
           available for use again.

        If you have a troublesome ``User`` and wish to disable their
        account while keeping it in the database, simply delete the
        associated :class:`RegistrationProfile`; an inactive ``User`` which
        does not have an associated :class:`RegistrationProfile` will not
        be deleted.
